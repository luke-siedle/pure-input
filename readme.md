This is a very old unmaintained plugin I was selling on codecanyon, and have made available for free for those users who arrived on that page.

It still functional but it's 2 years old, and I was a very different coder back then, so I'm unlikely to resurrect it. You'd do better to extend Twitter Typeahead to have a tokenizer or something similar, but here it is anyway.

What does it do? It basically handles autocomplete, along with tokens similar to those on Facebook. It works reasonably well all things considered. If you really want to use it in production, you might want to refactor large parts of the code.

Full documentation at /index.html for comprehensive details on installation and usage (the old demo page).
